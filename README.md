## Overview

This Python project focuses on text clustering using MiniBatchKMeans and TF-IDF Vectorization. The goal is to cluster textual data and identify significant terms within each cluster.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

### Project Structure
- textClustering.py: Main script for text clustering.
- stopWords.txt: File containing stop words.
- finefoods.txt: Text data file.

### Generated Outpiut files

- top_500words.txt: Top 500 words in the text data.
- top_words_centroids.txt: Top terms per cluster.

### Results
The script will print the following results:

- Top 500 words in the text data.
- Centroids of clusters.
- Top terms per cluster.
